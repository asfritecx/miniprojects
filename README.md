## Some Mini Projects I did to explore and improve my knowledge

With the influx of ChatGPT learning programming is not as difficult as before. Therefore during my freetime I tend to create programs to expand my knowledge.

### 1. MTLSDemo
A Project made in dotnet 8.0 with the help of CHATGPT to understand how mutual TLS works 

### 2. AzureRelated/blobsasuploader
Simple dotnet 8 console program to upload any files stored in the folder into Azure Blob Storage

### 3. Jason Library Management System Sample Web Application (JLMS)
A Project made in dotnet core 8.0 Model view controller architecture to try and understand some basics of how a asp.net core 8 web application works
